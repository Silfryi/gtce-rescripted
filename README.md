# GTCE-ReScripted
A MC Modpack taking SoG & GTCE and making them a little less overboard via extremely liberal amounts of CraftTweaker

Aims of the project are as follows
 - Make a GT:CE Script package that makes a GT I can enjoy
    - This entails middling complexity
    - This also entails massive JEI cleanups to reduce the amount of unusable stuff that is there
 - Remove the influences of GT5u on GTCE where unnecessary - tiers past EV are removed for machines
 - Provide an IV-level boost in manufacturing capabilities that will make IV the "end" tier for the player, with fusion and the assembly line
 - Remove some continutally pernicious materials - tin and cassiterite come to mind, as do the barely-used fissile materials GTCE added to do nothing with
 - Reduce single-use materials. Materials like colored steels that had about three uses between all three of them combined are gone, replaced by others
 - Remove useless lower-game tiering. Start with wrought iron (steel) steam machines, move on to LV once you have steel
 - Provide more of a focus on core materials and less on minor ones - more focus on steel & copper, the materials you collect the most of
 - Make the material progression make more sense. Pumps and rotors have dedicated "corrosion-resistant" materials, etc
 - Revamp ore processing side lines: No more pure-metal ores if they're impossible IRL (Aluminium, Beryllium), more pyroprocessing and less electrolysis
 - Revamp ore generation: ore generation follows IRL generation paradigms more, and has fewer "single-color" veins
 - Move generation focus to larger multiblock generators early, as industry has always preferred one or two generators per factory instead of 32 singles
 - Provide an actual Vanilla overhaul a la sort of how GT6 does, except also toned down - provide the player as many boosts as you take away
